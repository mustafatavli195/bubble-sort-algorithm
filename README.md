This C# console application demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort randomly generated arrays of integers. The program allows users to specify the size of the array and generates random integers to populate it. After sorting the array using Bubble Sort, the sorted result is displayed along with the execution time

## Features:
- Dynamic array size based on user input.
- Random integer generation.
- Bubble Sort implementation.
- Display of execution time.

## Usage:

1. Run the application.
2. Enter the desired size of the array.
3. View the generated random array.
4. See the sorted array using Bubble Sort.
5. Repeat the process if desired.
